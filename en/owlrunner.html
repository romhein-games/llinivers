      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p><strong>OwlRunner</strong> is a fast-paced and dynamic mobile game in which the main character runs automatically through a procedurally generated environment.
      The goal is simple: <strong>survive as long as possible</strong> by avoiding obstacles and collecting various bonuses.<br><br>
        
      You play as a hero launched into a frantic race, with the speed continuously increasing as the game progresses. The difficulty naturally ramps up the further you go, putting your reflexes and anticipation 
      skills to the test.<br> <br>
        
      To get as far as possible and complete each level, you’ll need to gather <strong>air flasks</strong> o stay alive, eliminate as many <strong>monsters</strong>as possible, and dodge the numerous obstacles placed 
      along the path. Coins are also scattered throughout the run: collecting them boosts your score and allows you to unlock certain advantages.<br> <br>
        
      To help you during the race, various power-ups can be picked up, temporarily granting enhanced abilities. You can also purchase permanent upgrades to make progression easier and improve your performance.<br> <br>
        
      Each completed level <strong>unlocks the next one</strong>, roviding a constant sense of progression and new challenges to overcome.</p>

      
      <h3>Pitch</h3>
      <p>In the <strong>county of Haleron</strong>, an unprecedented climate disaster has struck, rendering the surface air <strong>toxic and impossible to breathe</strong>.
      Trapped in this now-hostile world, <strong>Zigowl</strong> struggles to find a single breath of clean air. His ability to breathe is fading quickly, and every second counts.<br><br>
        
      Step into Zigowl’s shoes and help him reach a place where his life will no longer be at risk. To survive, you’ll need to cross the <strong>various towns of Haleron</strong> 
      and climb the county’s rugged terrain to reach the <strong>highest altitudes</strong>, where the air is still breathable.<br><br>
        
      The path will be difficult, but it’s the only way to survive.</p>

      
      <h3>Character</h3>
      <p><strong>Zigowl</strong> is the main protagonist of the game. He is an unusual and instantly recognizable character: a dark, mysterious silhouette with 
      <strong>large, bulbous eyes</strong> that reflect his constant sense of wonder, and <strong>small pointed ears</strong> that emphasize his distinctive appearance.<br><br>
      A hero as strange as he is endearing, ready to do whatever it takes to survive in a world that has become hostile.</p>

         <img src="../images/IDLE.gif" alt="Idle">
         <img src="../images/WALK.gif" alt="Idle">
      </div>

      
      <h3>How to play</h3>
      <p>As soon as the game starts, Zigowl automatically begins moving, running to the right without any input from the player. His movement is <strong>unidirectional</strong>, 
      and his <strong>speed gradually increases</strong> as you progress through the levels, making the gameplay more and more intense. Even though he moves on his own, Zigowl remains under the player’s <strong>full 
      control</strong>, who must manage three essential actions: <strong>jumping</strong>, <strong>shooting</strong> and <strong>collecting items</strong>.<br><br>
        
      <u>Possible Actions</u> <br><br>
        
      <strong>Jumping</strong><br> 
      To make Zigowl leap and avoid obstacles, simply tap the <strong>left side</strong> of the screen.<br><br>
        
      <strong>Shooting</strong><br>  
      To attack a monster, the player must tap the <strong>right side</strong> of the screen, aiming in the direction of the target to eliminate.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Collecting Items</strong><br>   
      Items are automatically picked up as soon as Zigowl comes into contact with them, making the action smooth and intuitive.</p>

      <div class="pic">
         <img src="../images/CMD.png" alt="Hud">
      </div>
        
      <p><u>Resources</u> <br><br>

      <strong>Gold</strong><br>
      While survival is the main objective, collecting gold is just as important.<br>               
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ Each <strong>gold coin</strong> collected increases your total by 1.</span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ Defeating a monster awards <strong>5 gold coins</strong>, rewarding the player for taking risks.</span><br><br>

      <strong>Lives</strong><br>
      Lives allow the player to continue their run <strong>without losing their score</strong>, bringing them back exactly to the point where they failed.<br>               
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ With remaining lives, the player continues their progress.</span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ Without lives, it’s <strong>Game Over</strong>: the player must restart from the beginning of the last level reached.</span><br><br>  

      <strong>Air flasks</strong><br>
      Zigowl’s air level continuously decreases over time.<br>               
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ An empty gauge results in his death.</span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;">→ To survive, he must collect <strong>air flasks</strong>, which instantly refill his oxygen supply.</span><br><br>    
     
      <strong>Power-ups</strong><br>
      During the run, Zigowl may encounter <strong>power-ups</strong> that temporarily enhance his abilities. Among them:<br>               
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Invincibility Potion</strong></span><br>
          <span style="padding-left: 40px; display:inline-block;">→ 30 seconds of total invincibility, paired with supersonic speed.</span><br><br>    
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Laser Boost Potion</strong></span><br>
          <span style="padding-left: 40px; display:inline-block;">→ 30 seconds of exceptional shooting power: <strong>one hit destroys everything</strong>.</span><br><br>    
      These bonuses appear randomly, making each run unique.<br><br>   

      <u>Interface: Head up display</u></p>

      <div class="pic">
         <img src="../images/HUD.png" alt="Hud">
      </div>
      
      <p>The HUD displays all useful information and quick access buttons<br>
      1 – <strong>Zigowl’s Health Bar</strong><br>
      2 – <strong>Number of Lives</strong> available<br>
      3 – <strong>Total Coins</strong> collected<br>
      4 – <strong>Controls Button</strong><br>
      5 – <strong>Pause Button</strong><br><br>

      <u>Conditions de mort</u> <br><br>
      
      Zigowl can lose the game in the following situations:<br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Collision with a monster</strong>: any contact is fatal.</span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Falling into a pit</strong>: a single fall is enough to cause death.</span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Running out of air</strong>: if the air gauge reaches zero, Zigowl will not survive.</span><br><br>

      <u>Victory conditions</u> <br><br>
      The player completes the level as soon as they reach the end of the course, unlocking the next level.<br><br>
      Based on the amount of gold collected, the player is awarded 1 to 3 stars. Each star grants an additional 50 gold coins, for a maximum of 150 bonus coins.
      </p>

      <h3>Game Modes</h3>
      <p>The player can choose between <strong>three game modes</strong>:<br> 
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Easy</strong></span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Normal</strong></span><br>
        <span style="padding-left: 20px; display:inline-block;"><strong>→ Hard</strong></span><br><br>
        
      Each mode directly affects the gameplay experience. Depending on the chosen level, the monsters’ artificial intelligence (AI) will be more or less active, making enemies more aggressive and unpredictable. 
      The selected mode also affects the rate at which the character’s air gauge decreases: the higher the difficulty, the faster Zigowl loses air.<br><br>

      This choice allows the player to adjust the intensity and challenge according to their play style.
